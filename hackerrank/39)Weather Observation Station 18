Consider P1(a,b) and p2(c,d) to be two points on a 2D plane.
a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
d happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points p1 and p2 and round it to a scale of 4 decimal places.

OUTPUT:
259.6859
