/*
Given the table schemas below, write a query to print the company_code, founder name, total number of lead managers, 
total number of senior managers, total number of managers, and total number of employees. Order your output by ascending company_code.
Note:
The tables may contain duplicate records.
The company_code is string, so the sorting should not be numeric. For example, if the company_codes are C_1, C_2, and C_10,
then the ascending company_codes will be C_1, C_10, and C_2.

OUTPUT:
C1 Angela 1 2 5 13 
C10 Earl 1 1 2 3 
C100 Aaron 1 2 4 10 
C11 Robert 1 1 1 1 
C12 Amy 1 2 6 14 
C13 Pamela 1 2 5 14 
C14 Maria 1 1 3 5
