/*
QN:P(R) represents a pattern drawn by Julia in R rows. The following pattern represents P(5):

* * * * * 
* * * * 
* * *

*
Write a query to print the pattern P(20).

EXPLANATION:
DELIMITER $$ and DELIMITER ;: Changes the statement delimiter to $$ for defining the stored procedure and resets it to ; afterward.
CREATE PROCEDURE PrintPattern(): Defines a stored procedure named PrintPattern.
DECLARE i INT;: Declares a variable i to track the current row.
SET i = 20;: Initializes the variable i to 20.
WHILE i > 0 DO: Starts a loop to generate each row of the pattern.
SELECT REPEAT('* ', i) AS pattern_row;: Uses the REPEAT function to generate a row with 
𝑖
i repetitions of '* '.
SET i = i - 1;: Decrements the counter to move to the next row.
CALL PrintPattern();: Calls the procedure to execute it.
