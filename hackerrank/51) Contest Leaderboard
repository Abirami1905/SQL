/*
You did such a great job helping Julia with her last coding contest challenge that she wants you to work on this one, too!

The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name,
and total score of the hackers ordered by the descending score. If more than one hacker achieved the same total score,
then sort the result by ascending hacker_id.
Exclude all hackers with a total score of 0 from your result.

OUTPUT:
4071 Rose 191
74842 Lisa 174
84072 Bonnie 100
4806 Angela 89
26071 Frank 85
80305 Kimberly 67
